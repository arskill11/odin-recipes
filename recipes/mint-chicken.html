        <p>A favourite family recipe that my mom has made for hundreds of guests. Fresh lemon juice and mint leaves are a must!
            Serve over hot cooked white rice.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves-cut
                into bite-size pieces</li>
            <li>1 clove gralic, crushed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup margarine</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic.
            Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken
            pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover
            and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not
            over cook the chicken or it will be tough.</p>
        </ol>
